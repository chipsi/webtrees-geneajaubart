"/><ul><li><b>Formats</b><br />Pictures can be edited and saved in many "
"formats.  For example, .jpg, .png, .bmp, .gif, etc.  If the same original "
"picture was used to create each of the formats, the viewed image will appear "
"to be the same size no matter which format is used.  However, the image "
"files stored in the database will vary considerably in size.  Generally, "
".jpg images are considered to the most efficient in terms of storage "
"space.</li><li><b>Image size</b><br />The larger the original image, the "
"larger will be the resultant file's size. The picture should fit on the "
"screen without scrolling; the maximum width or height should not be more "
"than the width or height of the screen. <b>webtrees</b> is designed for "
"screens of 1024x768 pixels but not all of this space is available for "
"viewing pictures; the picture's size should be set accordingly.  To reduce "
"file sizes, smaller pictures are more "
"desirable.</li><li><b>Resolution</b><br />The resolution of a picture is "
"usually measured in \"dpi\" (dots/inch), but this is valid only for printed "
"pictures.  When considering pictures shown on screen, the only correct way "
"is to use total dots or pixels. When printed, the picture could have a "
"resolution of 150 - 300 dpi or more depending on the printer. Screen "
"resolutions are rarely better than 50 pixels per inch.  If your picture will "
"never be printed, you can safely lower its resolution (and consequently its "
"file size) without affecting picture quality.  If a low-resolution picture "
"is printed with too great a magnification, its quality will suffer; it will "
"have a grainy appearance.</li><li><b>Color depth</b><br />Another way to "
"keep a file small is to decrease the number of colors that you use.  The "
"number of colors can differ from pure black and white (two colors) to true "
"colors (millions of colors) and anything in between.  You can see that the "
"more colors are used, the bigger the size of the files.</li></ul><b>Why is "
"it important to keep the file size small?</b><br /><ul><li>First of all: Our "
"webspace is limited.  The more large files there are, the more web space we "
"need on the server. The more space we need, the higher our "
"costs.</li><li>Bandwidth.  The more data our server has to send to the "
"remote location (your location), the more we have to pay.  This is because "
"the carrying capacity of the server's connection to the Internet is limited, "
"and the link has to be shared (and paid for) by all of the applications "
"running on the server.  <b>webtrees</b> is one of many applications that "
"share the server.  The cost is normally apportioned according to the amount "
"of data each application sends and receives.</li><li>Download time. If you "
"have large files, the user (also you) will have to wait long for the page to "
"download from the server.  Not everybody is blessed with a cable connection, "
"broadband or DSL.</li></ul><b>How to upload your MM</b><br />There are two "
"ways to upload media to the site.  If you have a lot of media items to "
"upload you should contact the site administrator to discuss the best ways.  "
"If it has been enabled by your site administrator, you can use the Upload "

"files stored in the database will vary considerably in size.  Generally, "
".jpg images are considered to the most efficient in terms of storage "
"space.</li><li><b>Image size</b><br />The larger the original image, the "
"larger will be the resultant file’s size. The picture should fit on the "
"screen without scrolling; the maximum width or height should not be more "
"than the width or height of the screen. <b>webtrees</b> is designed for "
"screens of 1024x768 pixels but not all of this space is available for "
"viewing pictures; the picture’s size should be set accordingly.  To reduce "
"file sizes, smaller pictures are more "
"desirable.</li><li><b>Resolution</b><br />The resolution of a picture is "
"usually measured in \"dpi\" (dots/inch), but this is valid only for printed "
"pictures.  When considering pictures shown on screen, the only correct way "
"is to use total dots or pixels. When printed, the picture could have a "
"resolution of 150 - 300 dpi or more depending on the printer. Screen "
"resolutions are rarely better than 50 pixels per inch.  If your picture will "
"never be printed, you can safely lower its resolution (and consequently its "
"file size) without affecting picture quality.  If a low-resolution picture "
"is printed with too great a magnification, its quality will suffer; it will "
"have a grainy appearance.</li><li><b>Colour depth</b><br />Another way to "
"keep a file small is to decrease the number of colours that you use.  The "
"number of colours can differ from pure black and white (two colours) to true "
"colours (millions of colours) and anything in between.  You can see that the "
"more colours are used, the bigger the size of the files.</li></ul><b>Why is "
"it important to keep the file size small?</b><br /><ul><li>First of all: Our "
"webspace is limited.  The more large files there are, the more web space we "
"need on the server. The more space we need, the higher our "
"costs.</li><li>Bandwidth.  The more data our server has to send to the "
"remote location (your location), the more we have to pay.  This is because "
"the carrying capacity of the server’s connection to the Internet is limited "
"and the link has to be shared (and paid for) by all of the applications "
"running on the server.  <b>webtrees</b> is one of many applications that "
"share the server.  The cost is normally apportioned according to the amount "
"of data each application sends and receives.</li><li>Download time. If you "
"have large files, the user (also you) will have to wait long for the page to "
"download from the server.  Not everybody is blessed with a cable connection, "
"broadband or DSL.</li></ul><b>How to upload your MM</b><br />There are two "
"ways to upload media to the site.  If you have a lot of media items to "
"upload you should contact the site administrator to discuss the best ways.  "
"If it has been enabled by your site administrator, you can use the Upload "
"Media form under your My Page menu.  You can also use the Upload option on "
"the Multimedia form to upload media items."

#~ "/>The <b>R</b> code is somewhat unusual in its behavior.  When this code "

#~ "the page language is Arabic, the <b>Hijri</b> calendar will be used.  For "
#~ "all other page languages, the <b>French Revolutionary</b> calendar is "
#~ "used.<br /><br />The action of this code is similar to the choice of "
#~ "calendar format that you can make on the GEDCOM Configuration page.  The "
#~ "difference between the two methods is that the <b>R</b> code, being defined "
#~ "at the Language Configuration level, works only on selected languages but "
#~ "across all GEDCOMs on the site.  The calendar option set at the GEDCOM "
#~ "Configuration level works on all languages but only on the GEDCOMs for which "

#~ "/>The <b>R</b> code is somewhat unusual in its behavior. When this code "
#~ "appears in the date format, the normal date will be shown a second time, but "
#~ "in a different calendar system. The elements of this alternate calendar date "
#~ "will obey the same rules as those of the main part of the format "
#~ "specification, except that the output of the <b>R</b> formatting code is "
#~ "enclosed in parentheses to distinguish it from the regular date. The "
#~ "examples given under <b>French Revolutionary</b> calendar will make this a "
#~ "little clearer.<br /><br />The alternate calendar to be used for the "
#~ "<b>R</b> code is determined according to the current page language. When the "
#~ "page language is Hebrew, the <b>Jewish</b> calendar will be used. When the "
#~ "page language is Arabic, the <b>Hijri</b> calendar will be used. For all "
#~ "other page languages, the <b>French Revolutionary</b> calendar is used.<br "
#~ "/><br />The action of this code is similar to the choice of calendar format "
#~ "that you can make on the GEDCOM Configuration page. The difference between "
#~ "the two methods is that the <b>R</b> code, being defined at the Language "
#~ "Configuration level, works only on selected languages but across all GEDCOMs "
#~ "on the site. The calendar option set at the GEDCOM Configuration level works "
#~ "on all languages but only on the GEDCOMs for which that option has been "
#~ "set.<br /><ul><li><b>French Revolutionary</b> calendar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "
#~ "calendar is also called <b>French Republican</b> calendar.<br /><br />Except "
#~ "for a very brief period in May 1871, this calendar system was only in use in "
#~ "France and only between 22&nbsp;SEP&nbsp;1792 and 31&nbsp;DEC&nbsp;1805. "
#~ "Accordingly, the French Revolutionary calendar format will only be "
#~ "applicable when the date is within that range.<br /><br />Two example date "
#~ "formats, assuming the page language to be English, will illustrate the "
#~ "action of the <b>R</b> code:<br /><b>Y.m.d&nbsp;R</b> could produce "
#~ "<b>1805.04.26&nbsp;(XIII.08.06)</b> or <b>1806.01.01</b>;&nbsp; "

#~ "<u>draft</u> Standard, to which <b>webtrees</b> adheres, can be downloaded "
#~ "in PDF format here:&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.phpgedview.net/ged551-5.pdf\" "
#~ "target=\"_blank\">GEDCOM 5.5.1 Standard</a>  This Standard is only available "
#~ "in English.<br /><br />The GEDCOM file contains all the information about "
#~ "the family. All facts, dates, events, etc. are stored here. GEDCOM files "
#~ "have to follow strict rules because they must be exchangeable between many "
#~ "programs, independent of platforms or operating systems.\n"
#~ "\t\t<br /><br /><span class=\"helpstart\">Dates in a GEDCOM file</span><br "
#~ "/><br />Although the date field allows for free-form entry (meaning you can "
#~ "type in whatever you want), there are some rules about how dates should be "
#~ "entered according to the GEDCOM 5.5.1 standard.<ol><li>A full date is "
#~ "entered in the form DD MMM YYYY.  For example, <b>01&nbsp;MAR&nbsp;1801</b> "
#~ "or <b>14&nbsp;DEC&nbsp;1950</b>.</li><li>If you are missing a part of the "
#~ "date, you can omit that part.  E.g. <b>MAR&nbsp;1801</b> or "
#~ "<b>14&nbsp;DEC</b>.</li><li>If you are not sure or the date is not "
#~ "confirmed, you could enter <b>ABT&nbsp;MAR&nbsp;1801</b> (abt = about), "
#~ "<b>BEF&nbsp;20&nbsp;DEC&nbsp;1950</b> (bef = before), <b>AFT&nbsp;1949</b> "
#~ "(aft = after)</li><li>Date ranges are entered as "
#~ "<b>FROM&nbsp;MAR&nbsp;1801&nbsp;TO&nbsp;20&nbsp;DEC&nbsp;1810</b> or as "
#~ "<b>BET&nbsp;MAR&nbsp;1801&nbsp;AND&nbsp;20&nbsp;DEC&nbsp;1810</b> (bet = "
#~ "between)<br /><br />The <b>FROM</b> form indicates that the event being "
#~ "described happened continuously between the stated dates and is used with "
#~ "events such as employment. The <b>BET</b> form indicates a single occurrence "
#~ "of the event, sometime between the stated dates and is used with events such "
#~ "as birth.<br /><br />Imprecise dates, where the day of the month or the "
#~ "month is missing, are always interpreted as the first or last possible date, "
#~ "depending on whether that imprecise date occurs before or after the "
#~ "separating keyword.  For example, <b>FEB&nbsp;1804</b> is interpreted as "
#~ "<b>01&nbsp;FEB&nbsp;1804</b> when it occurs before the TO or AND, and as "
#~ "<b>29&nbsp;FEB&nbsp;1804</b> when it occurs after the TO or "
#~ "AND.</li></ol><b>Be sure to enter dates and abbreviations in "
#~ "<u>English</u>,</b> because then the GEDCOM file is exchangeable and "
#~ "<b>webtrees</b> can translate all dates and abbreviations properly into the "
#~ "currently active language.  Furthermore, <b>webtrees</b> does calculations "
#~ "using these dates. If improper dates are entered into date fields, "
#~ "<b>webtrees</b> will not be able to calculate properly.<br /><br />You can "
#~ "click on the Calendar icon for help selecting a date.\n"
#~ "\t\t<br /><br /><span class=\"helpstart\">Location levels</span><br /><br "
#~ "/>This shows the levels that are displayed now.  The list box showing places "
#~ "is actually a sublist of the leftmost level.<br /><br />EXAMPLE:<br />The "
#~ "default order is City, County, State/Province, Country.<br />If the current "
#~ "level is \"Top Level\", the box will list all the countries in the "
#~ "database.<br />If the current level is \"U.S.A., Top Level\", the box will "
#~ "list all the states in the U.S.A.<br />etc.<br /><br />You can click a level "
#~ "to go back one or more steps."

#~ "algorithm is not well suited to names that were originally in languages "
#~ "other than English, and even with English names the results are very "
#~ "surprising.  For example, a Basic Soundex search for <b>Smith</b> will "
#~ "return not only <b>Smith, Smid, Smit, Schmidt, Smyth, Smithe, Smithee, "
#~ "Schmitt</b>, all of which are clearly variations of <b>Smith</b>, but also "

#~ "If, for example, you want to search for an event on December 14, you should "

#~ "/>~Search the way you think the name is written (Soundex)~<br /><br "
#~ "/>Soundex is a method of coding words according to their pronunciation.  "
#~ "This allows you to search the database for names and places when you don't "
#~ "know precisely how they are written.  <b>webtrees</b> supports two different "
#~ "Soundex algorithms that produce vastly different "
#~ "results.<ul><li><b>Basic</b><br />This method, patented in 1918 by Russell, "
#~ "is very simple and can be done by hand.<br /><br />Because the Basic method "
#~ "retains the first letter of the name as part of the resultant code, it is "
#~ "not very helpful when you are unsure of that first letter.  The Basic "
#~ "algorithm is not well suited to names that were originally in languages "
#~ "other than English and even with English names the results are very "
#~ "surprising.  For example, a Basic Soundex search for <b>Smith</b> will "
#~ "return not only <b>Smith, Smid, Smit, Schmidt, Smyth, Smithe, Smithee, "
#~ "Schmitt</b>, all of which are clearly variations of <b>Smith</b>, but also "
#~ "<b>Smead, Sneed, Smoote, Sammett, Shand,</b> and <b>Snoddy</b>.  <br /><br "
#~ "/></li><li><b>Daitch-Mokotoff</b><br />This method, developed in 1985, is "
#~ "much more complex than the Basic method and is not easily done by hand.<br "
#~ "/><br />A Soundex search using this method produces much more accurate "
#~ "results.</li></ul>For details on both Soundex algorithms, visit this <a "
