"/><ul><li><b>Formats</b><br />Pictures can be edited and saved in many "
"formats.  For example, .jpg, .png, .bmp, .gif, etc.  If the same original "
"picture was used to create each of the formats, the viewed image will appear "
"to be the same size no matter which format is used.  However, the image "
"files stored in the database will vary considerably in size.  Generally, "
".jpg images are considered to the most efficient in terms of storage "
"space.</li><li><b>Image size</b><br />The larger the original image, the "
"larger will be the resultant file's size. The picture should fit on the "
"screen without scrolling; the maximum width or height should not be more "
"than the width or height of the screen. <b>webtrees</b> is designed for "
"screens of 1024x768 pixels but not all of this space is available for "
"viewing pictures; the picture's size should be set accordingly.  To reduce "
"file sizes, smaller pictures are more "
"desirable.</li><li><b>Resolution</b><br />The resolution of a picture is "
"usually measured in \"dpi\" (dots/inch), but this is valid only for printed "
"pictures.  When considering pictures shown on screen, the only correct way "
"is to use total dots or pixels. When printed, the picture could have a "
"resolution of 150 - 300 dpi or more depending on the printer. Screen "
"resolutions are rarely better than 50 pixels per inch.  If your picture will "
"never be printed, you can safely lower its resolution (and consequently its "
"file size) without affecting picture quality.  If a low-resolution picture "
"is printed with too great a magnification, its quality will suffer; it will "
"have a grainy appearance.</li><li><b>Color depth</b><br />Another way to "
"keep a file small is to decrease the number of colors that you use.  The "
"number of colors can differ from pure black and white (two colors) to true "
"colors (millions of colors) and anything in between.  You can see that the "
"more colors are used, the bigger the size of the files.</li></ul><b>Why is "
"it important to keep the file size small?</b><br /><ul><li>First of all: Our "
"webspace is limited.  The more large files there are, the more web space we "
"need on the server. The more space we need, the higher our "
"costs.</li><li>Bandwidth.  The more data our server has to send to the "
"remote location (your location), the more we have to pay.  This is because "
"the carrying capacity of the server's connection to the Internet is limited, "
"and the link has to be shared (and paid for) by all of the applications "
"running on the server.  <b>webtrees</b> is one of many applications that "
"share the server.  The cost is normally apportioned according to the amount "
"of data each application sends and receives.</li><li>Download time. If you "
"have large files, the user (also you) will have to wait long for the page to "
"download from the server.  Not everybody is blessed with a cable connection, "
"broadband or DSL.</li></ul><b>How to upload your MM</b><br />There are two "
"ways to upload media to the site.  If you have a lot of media items to "
"upload you should contact the site administrator to discuss the best ways.  "
"If it has been enabled by your site administrator, you can use the Upload "

"to be the same size no matter which format is used.  However, the image "
"files stored in the database will vary considerably in size.  Generally, "
".jpg images are considered to the most efficient in terms of storage "
"space.</li><li><b>Image size</b><br />The larger the original image, the "
"larger will be the resultant file's size. The picture should fit on the "
"screen without scrolling; the maximum width or height should not be more "
"than the width or height of the screen. <b>webtrees</b> is designed for "
"screens of 1024x768 pixels but not all of this space is available for "
"viewing pictures; the picture's size should be set accordingly.  To reduce "
"file sizes, smaller pictures are more "
"desirable.</li><li><b>Resolution</b><br />The resolution of a picture is "
"usually measured in \"dpi\" (dots/inch), but this is valid only for printed "
"pictures.  When considering pictures shown on screen, the only correct way "
"is to use total dots or pixels. When printed, the picture could have a "
"resolution of 150 - 300 dpi or more depending on the printer. Screen "
"resolutions are rarely better than 50 pixels per inch.  If your picture will "
"never be printed, you can safely lower its resolution (and consequently its "
"file size) without affecting picture quality.  If a low-resolution picture "
"is printed with too great a magnification, its quality will suffer; it will "
"have a grainy appearance.</li><li><b>Colour depth</b><br />Another way to "
"keep a file small is to decrease the number of colours that you use.  The "
"number of colours can differ from pure black and white (two colours) to true "
"colours (millions of colours) and anything in between.  You can see that the "
"more colours are used, the bigger the size of the files.</li></ul><b>Why is "
"it important to keep the file size small?</b><br /><ul><li>First of all: Our "
"webspace is limited.  The more large files there are, the more web space we "
"need on the server. The more space we need, the higher our "
"costs.</li><li>Bandwidth.  The more data our server has to send to the "
"remote location (your location), the more we have to pay.  This is because "
"the carrying capacity of the server's connection to the Internet is limited, "
"and the link has to be shared (and paid for) by all of the applications "
"running on the server.  <b>webtrees</b> is one of many applications that "
"share the server.  The cost is normally apportioned according to the amount "
"of data each application sends and receives.</li><li>Download time. If you "
"have large files, the user (also you) will have to wait long for the page to "
"download from the server.  Not everybody is blessed with a cable connection, "
"broadband or DSL.</li></ul><b>How to upload your MM</b><br />There are two "
"ways to upload media to the site.  If you have a lot of media items to "
"upload you should contact the site administrator to discuss the best ways.  "
"If it has been enabled by your site administrator, you can use the Upload "
"Media form under your My Page menu.  You can also use the Upload option on "
"the Multimedia form to upload media items."
